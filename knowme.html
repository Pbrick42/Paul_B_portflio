<h1>Owner/Creator Paul Brickey</h1>
  <p>I started coded just about a year ago and thats why I still only make simple wedsites and designs. I started this to one, strengthen my skills and two, offer people a chance to get their very own website.
I've always wanted to do something with computers, I wanted to create something that would be used and enjoyed by people and thats why this website was created! My goal with this like I have said mulitiple times before is the 
give poeple's idea's access to the internet so that they are able to take off in a fantastic way! I want people to be able to spread information helpfully information about anything and everything, like mental health awareness or exercise tips, 
anything that will be able make this place a little better for everyone, everywhere. It's for sure a huge goal to set for oneself but I think it's just something that will help me personally move forward with my own life, knowing that I will 
be doing my little part to help.</p>
