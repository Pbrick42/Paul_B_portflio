    <h3>Your one stop shop for the best starter webpages out there!</h3>
      <p>I recently completed the Google IT support professional certificate and currently working towards completing my CompTIA A+ certificate and
        extremely excited to start a career in IT support! I've always been
        interested in computers and how they work, 
        solving problems and helping people have always been something I've wanted to do for my career.
